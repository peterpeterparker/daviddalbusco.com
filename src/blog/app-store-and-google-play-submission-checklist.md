One of my current client requested a list of the **bare minimum** information required to publish their app in the App Store and Google Play. Once again, I did not remember where I saved such check-list üòÖ.

That‚Äôs why, instead of charging them for such process, I had the idea to wrap up these information in form of a public blog post I‚Äôll try, hopefully with your help and inputs, to maintain up-to-date.

### Last Update

This blog post has been updated for the last time **Tuesday 3rd November 2020**.

### Distribution

Following questions have to be answered in order to distribute the app in both **App Store** and **Google Play**:

<span>1.</span> Is the app available everywhere (in the world) for download or should it only available in particular countries?

If for example you restrain the distribution to a country such as ‚ÄúSwitzerland‚Äù, a potential user who registered his/her account in another App Store located country, as for example ‚ÄúGermany‚Äù, would not be able to find and download the application.

<span>2.</span> Is it for free or what‚Äôs its selling price?

<span>3.</span> Does the app contain ads?

<span>4.</span> Which category is the most accurate and effective for the app?

You can find a list and introduction to the categories via these links:

- App Store: [https://developer.apple.com/app-store/categories/](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/categories/)
- Google Play: [https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/113475?hl=en](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/113475?hl=en)

In addition, **Google Play** (only) request following information about the app‚Äôs content:

<span>5.</span> Content ratings: the application‚Äôs has to receive content ratings from official rating authorities.

For example: PEGI-3. To get these, a step by step wizard is built-in the Google Play console.

<span>6.</span> Target audience: the target age group of the app

### External Links

Both stores require links, external URLs, to information such as data privacy or terms of use.

**App Store:**

- Data privacy
- Support: a link to a page where your potential users can request help
- Marketing: a link to a page about commercial information regarding your application
- Copyright: name or entity which owns the legal right

**Google Play:**

- Data privacy
- Terms of use: I am actually not sure anymore it is required. I‚Äôll check next time I submit a new application.
- E-mail: a contact email which is going to be visible in store too

### Information

To introduce and showcase your application in store, you need to provide different information such as title, description etc. These have to be provided and have to match specific maximum lengths (including spaces).

**App Store:**

- Name: max. 30 characters
- Subtitle: max. 30 characters

Apple recommends using it to catch the eye of new potential users. It is worth to notice that it can be updated without having to submit a new build.

**Google Play:**

I hope it will be useful to you too and if you notice anything missing or which changed since its publication, please let me know.

To infinity and beyond!
