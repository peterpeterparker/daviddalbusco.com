I recently published a new open source [plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/950777256486678678/Figma-to-DeckDeckGo) to export [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) frames to [DeckDeckGo](https://deckdeckgo.com) slides.

As I like to benefit from my experiences to learn and try new concept, instead of using a bundler as described in the Figma documentation, I decided to give a try to [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/).

The least I can say, I loved it ‚ù§Ô∏è.

---

### Foreword

Following solution is the one I set up for my [plugin](https://github.com/deckgo/figma-deckdeckgo-plugin). It does work like a charm but, notably because it was the first time I used esbuild, it might need some improvements. If you notice improvements or issues, let me know, I would like to hear from you!

Contributions to my plugin and PR are also welcomed üòâ.

---

### Setup

In a Figma plugin, install both `esbuild` and `rimraf` .

```bash
npm i esbuild rimraf --save-dev
```

`rimraf` might not be needed, if you only build your project in a CI, nevertheless, for a local build, I think it is safer to delete the output directory before any new build.

In `package.json` add, or modify, the `build` script.

```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "rimraf dist && node ./esbuild.js"
}
```

You might notice that the last command target a script called `esbuild.js`. This file will contain our bundling steps, therefore create such a new file at the root of your project.

```bash
touch esbuild.js
```

Finally, in this newly created file, import `esbuild` .

```javascript
const esbuild = require("esbuild");
```

---

### Sandbox

A Figma plugin run (see [documentation](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/how-plugins-run/)) in a combination of a sandbox, to access to the Figma nodes, and an iFrame, for the presentation layer. We set up firstly the sandbox‚Äôs build.

```javascript
// sandbox

esbuild
	.build({
		entryPoints: ["src/plugin.ts"],
		bundle: true,
		platform: "node",
		target: ["node10.4"],
		outfile: "dist/plugin.js"
	})
	.catch(() => process.exit(1));
```

In the above script, we bundle the `plugin.ts`, the sandbox‚Äôs code, to its JavaScript counterpart `plugin.js` . As configuration, we tell `esbuild` to treat it as a NodeJS [platform](https://esbuild.github.io/api/#platform) and we [target](https://esbuild.github.io/api/#target) the version 10.4.

> I configured my plugin to handle sources from a folder `src`. I also bundle the outcome to another one called `dist`. If you do not have the same structure, modify the solution accordingly.

---

### UI

In comparison to the previous chapter, we are going to gather the results of the build instead of telling `esbuild` to write directly to a file. For such reason, we import NodeJS `fs` to interact with the file system.

```javascript
const { readFile, writeFile } = require("fs").promises;
```

We also install `html-minifier-terser` to minify the resulting HTML code.

```bash
npm i html-minifier-terser --save-dev
```

Once installed, we add a related import to our build script too.

```javascript
const minify = require("html-minifier-terser").minify;
```

These imports set, we implement the bundling.

```javascript
// iframe UI

(async () => {
	const script = esbuild.buildSync({
		entryPoints: ["src/ui.ts"],
		bundle: true,
		minify: true,
		write: false,
		target: ["chrome58", "firefox57", "safari11", "edge16"]
	});

	const html = await readFile("src/ui.html", "utf8");

	const minifyOptions = {
		collapseWhitespace: true,
		keepClosingSlash: true,
		removeComments: true,
		removeRedundantAttributes: true,
		removeScriptTypeAttributes: true,
		removeStyleLinkTypeAttributes: true,
		useShortDoctype: true,
		minifyCSS: true
	};

	await writeFile(
		"dist/ui.html",
		`<script>${script.outputFiles[0].text}</script>${await minify(html, minifyOptions)}`
	);
})();
```

In the above script, we compile the `ui.ts` , our TypeScript code related to the UI, with `esbuild` . We instruct it to inline any imported dependencies into the file itself with the option [bundle](https://esbuild.github.io/api/#bundle), we [minify](https://esbuild.github.io/api/#minify) the JavaScript code and, we do not [write](https://esbuild.github.io/api/#write) to the file system. Instead of such step, we gather the outcome in a variable I called `script` .

We read the `ui.html` source file, define some options for the HTML minification and, finally, write both compiled code and HTML to the output (`dist/ui.html` in this example).

---

### Web Components

Of course, I had to create some Web Components for my projects üòâ. Integrating these follow same logic as previously, except that we use the esm [format](https://esbuild.github.io/api/#format-commonjs).

```javascript
const buildWebComponents = (entryPoints) =>
	entryPoints
		.map((entryPoint) =>
			esbuild.buildSync({
				entryPoints: [entryPoint],
				bundle: true,
				minify: true,
				write: false,
				target: ["chrome58", "firefox57", "safari11", "edge16"],
				format: "esm"
			})
		)
		.map((componentScript) => componentScript.outputFiles[0].text)
		.join("");
(async () => {
	const componentsScript = buildWebComponents([
		"src/components/checkbox.ts",
		"src/components/button.ts",
		"src/components/spinner.ts",
		"src/components/fonts.ts"
	]);

	// Same as previous chapter

	await writeFile(
		"dist/ui.html",
		`<script>${
			script.outputFiles[0].text
		}</script><script type="module">${componentsScript}</script>${await minify(
			html,
			minifyOptions
		)}`
	);
})();
```

I created more than one Web Component (`checkbox.ts`, `button.ts`, etc.), that‚Äôs why the `buildWebComponents` function. It takes an array, a list of files, as parameter and, concat all bundle together to a single value.

And...that‚Äôs it üòÉ. Sandbox, UI and Web Components are bundled faster than ever ‚ö°Ô∏è.

### Repo

You can find above solution and, other fun stuff in the open source repo of my plugin: [https://github.com/deckgo/figma-deckdeckgo-plugin](https://github.com/deckgo/figma-deckdeckgo-plugin)

### Summary

Setting up a project with [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) was a pleasant developer experience. Writing a JS script to bundle my project, without many dependencies and with much flexibility, definitely matches my current inspiration. In addition, the outcome, the bundling itself, is faaaaaaaaaaaaaast! I am looking forward to use this compiler in other projects üëç.

To infinity and beyond!
