I am not sure anyone will ever need the following tricks but, at my client‚Äôs place, we have an application which can only be accessed through an URL which contains a dynamic base64 parameter. Needless to say, it makes its local development a bit inconvenient.

In addition, I have to admit, I am not a big fan of CLI‚Äôs options which can automatically open browser. Even though I mostly use the Chrome Incognito mode for development purpose, I like to switch often between browsers to try out what I developed.

Finally, I don‚Äôt use bookmarks (don‚Äôt judge me) and, I often switch between technologies. Therefore, without configuration, every time another port has to be used ( `:3333` or `:4200` or `:8000` or `:8100` etc.).

That‚Äôs why I had the idea to add a pre-start script to the application which should copy the start URL of the application to my clipboard. Doing so, I can then just select a browser, paste the URI and, I am good to go.

### Dependencies

In order to copy or read value to the clipboard from a NodeJS script, I used the library [clipboardy](https://github.com/sindresorhus/clipboardy) which implement such a cross-platform feature.

In addition, I also added [chalk](https://github.com/chalk/chalk) ann [boxen](https://github.com/sindresorhus/boxen) to print out the URL to the console in a stylish way.

You may notice that all these dependencies are open source and developed by the same person, [Sindre Sorhus](https://twitter.com/sindresorhus), which definitely deserve a shout-out for this awesome contribution and work üëç.

```bash
npm i clipboardy chalk boxen --save-dev
```

---

### Script

Once the dependencies fetched, I created the pre-start script itself. In this example, I create a file `start-url.js` at the root of the project.

The script primary generates the `url` which I am looking to copy in my clipboard. On purpose, I am using an `Hello World üëã` string to demonstrate that it is possible to encode complex parameters.

To print out a nice message, I use `chalk` with colors, in for- and background, and the bold option. I use `\n\n` to create newlines. It is worth to notice that the library offer many options such as combining or nesting styles.

Using `clipboardy` to copy the URL to the clipboard is actually really few work and can be solved by calling its function `copy` with the all URL as input parameter.

Finally, in a `console.log` , I print out the message inside a box generated with `boxen` .

```javascript
const { write: copy } = require("clipboardy");
const chalk = require("chalk");
const boxen = require("boxen");

const params = encodeURIComponent("Hello World üëã");

const url = `http://localhost:3333/profile/${params}`;

(async () => {
	let message = chalk.yellow.inverse("Your URL");

	message += `\n\n${chalk.bold(`${url}`)}`;

	try {
		await copy(url);
		message += `\n\n${chalk.grey("Copied local address to clipboard!")}`;
	} catch (err) {
		message = chalk.red.bold(`Cannot copy ${url} to clipboard ü•∫\n\n${err.message}`);
	}

	console.log(
		boxen(message, {
			borderStyle: "round",
			padding: 1,
			borderColor: "yellow",
			margin: 1
		})
	);
})();
```

### Life Cycle

Thanks to [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/scripts) it is possible to execute scripts at different life cycles. Because I was looking to copy the URL when I start locally the application, I added it as a `prestart` script to my `package.json`.

```json
"scripts": {
  "prestart": "node start-url.js"
}
```

You might ask ‚ÄúBut David, why a prestart and not poststart?‚Äù to which I would answer that `prestart` is executed for sure. On the contrary, `poststart`, is indeed also executed but, only when the `start` life cycle would be released. If your local server, as often, would stay active to watch for changes, `poststart` would only resolve when you would cancel your local server.

### Demo

Everything being in place, when I hit `npm run start` in my console, the URL is generated, copied to the clipboard and, I notice the following output.

If I open one of my browser, I can paste the result in the navigation bar.

Finally, hit `enter` and access my URL with the generated parameters.

### Summary

As underlined in the introduction of this post, I am really not sure if anyone will ever need this solution ever üòÖ. Anyway, I hope it was a fun read and let me know if you would improve anything.

To infinity and beyond!
