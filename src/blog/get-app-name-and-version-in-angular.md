I share [one trick a day](https://daviddalbusco.com/blog/how-to-call-the-service-worker-from-the-web-app-context) until the end of the COVID-19 quarantine in Switzerland, April 19th 2020. **Twenty-height** days left until hopefully better days.

Today, Sunday, I had to upgrade an application I‚Äôve developed last year with [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com) and [Angular](https://angular.io) because my client seems to finally have decided to publish it in stores (better start without technical debt üòâ).

I‚Äôve to say, the update process to Angular v9 and Ionic v5 went just smoothly. It took me a bit more time to upgrade the [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org) plugins, specially the one dedicated to Firebase, but fortunately I found the solution shared by his maintainer, [Dave Alden](https://twitter.com/dpa99c), who always does an outstanding job.

Once done, I was still facing one last issue. I didn‚Äôt touched the app in months and meanwhile, Google Analytics had been really deprecated and I was not able anymore to build my platform because the corresponding plugin was outdated.

Instead of finding the solution, I just removed my old GA implementation and migrated to the new Firebase Analytics implementation in less time than expected.

For the web, I‚Äôm using [AngularFire](https://github.com/angular/angularfire), which offers an option to track deployments with application‚Äôs name and versions.

Therefore here is how you can get or read the name and version of your application in Angular.

*****

### Import JSON File In TypeScript

We don‚Äôt want to duplicate the app‚Äôs name or version, that‚Äôs why I suggest that we read these from our `package.json` . In order to import JSON files in TypeScript, we need to instruct the compiler to accept such type of data. To do so, in our `tsonfig.json` we turn the option `resolveJsonModule` to `true` .

```json
"compilerOptions": {
  "resolveJsonModule": true
},
```

*****

### Environment Variables

A convenient way to handle environment variables is possible, out of the box, in Angular through the use of the multiples `environment.ts` files. That‚Äôs why we enhance these to ‚Äúinject‚Äù our application‚Äôs name and version.

```javascript
import {name, version} from '../../package.json';

export const environment = {
  production: true,
  name,
  version
};
```

That‚Äôs it, in our code we have now access the information üòÅ.

*****

### AngularFire Analytics

If like me, you use AngularFire and would like to track these information, proceed as the following in your `app.module.ts` . Note that in the spinet I also set `anonymize_ip` to `true` , as it should, in my humble opinion, always be the case.

```javascript
import {AngularFireAnalyticsModule, 
       APP_NAME, APP_VERSION, CONFIG} 
       from '@angular/fire/analytics';

import {environment} from '../environments/environment';

@NgModule({
   providers: [
     {
       provide: CONFIG,
       useValue: {
         allow_ad_personalization_signals: false,
         anonymize_ip: true
       }
     },
     {provide: APP_NAME, useValue: environment.name},
     {provide: APP_VERSION, useValue: environment.version}
    ]
})
export class AppModule {
}
```

### Summary

I‚Äôm agree, this isn‚Äôt the deepest and longest blog post I have ever written but I hope it might be useful anyway to someone in the future, one never knows üòÑ.

Stay home, stay safe!
