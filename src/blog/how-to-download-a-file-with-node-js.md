Over the weekend I made a dependency update of my time tracking app “Tie Tracker” ([PWA](https://tietracker.com) / [GitHub](https://github.com/peterpeterparker/tietracker)).

In this particular tool, I defer the heavy work to [Web Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers) so that the UI does not find itself in a blocking state.

Because the app is meant to work offline and, is available in the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tie-tracker/id1493399075) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tietracker.app), I did not import the required workers’ dependencies through a CDN but, locally.

The app itself is developed with [React](https://reactjs.org/) but, I implemented the workers with vanilla JavaScript and no package manager to handle their dependencies.

Therefore, I had to come with a solution to update the libs with a[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) script 😇.

### Node Fetch

There is no `window.fetch` like API in Node.js but, there is a light-weight module that brings such capabilities. That’s why I used [node-fetch](https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch) to implement the download of the file.

```bash
npm i node-fetch --save-dev
```

---

### Script

The script I developed to update my dependencies is the following:

```javascript
const { createWriteStream } = require("fs");
const { pipeline } = require("stream");
const { promisify } = require("util");
const fetch = require("node-fetch");

const download = async ({ url, path }) => {
	const streamPipeline = promisify(pipeline);

	const response = await fetch(url);

	if (!response.ok) {
		throw new Error(`unexpected response ${response.statusText}`);
	}

	await streamPipeline(response.body, createWriteStream(path));
};

(async () => {
	try {
		await download({
			url: "https://unpkg.com/...@latest/....min.js",
			path: "./public/workers/libs/....min.js"
		});
	} catch (err) {
		console.error(err);
	}
})();
```

The above `download` function uses a stream pipeline to download a file, as displayed in the node-fetch README, and the built-in `fs` module to write the output to the file system.

Top Level Await is available as of Node.js v14.8.0 but, I used an immediate function because I integrated it in a chain in which it was not available yet.

That’s it 🥳
