We are developing a proof of concept to port our web app, [DeckDeckGo](https://deckdeckgo.com/), to [DFINITY's Internet Computer](https://dfinity.org).

After having validated the hosting and password-less authentication integration, we are tackling the last question of our POC: persisting user data and presentations in the blockchain.

Along the way, we tried out two concepts:

* a ‚Äúconservative‚Äù one:  a data persistence in a single database-like storage
* a ‚Äúfuturistic ü§Ø‚Äù one: generate a database-like smart contract on the fly for each deck created by a user.

In this article I present these two approaches.

*****

### Introduction

The scope of this blog post is limited to simple key-value database concepts. That kind of persistence is the one we rely on in DeckDeckGo.

I do not know if anyone has yet implemented heavier concept with the IC (Internet Computer), such as a fully functional SQL database running in the chain.

You can of course challenge these by commenting the blog post or by reaching out üòÉ.

### The ‚ÄúNowadays‚Äù

Before digging into the Internet Computer, let's review first a common concept, a good old' school fashion way approach.

Nowadays, server-less or not, the data persistence is often solve with one database for all information.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*eWuHlblTCJMdrJVNllri9Q.png)

Users use the (web) application. It calls endpoint(s) to persist and read data and, it returns the results to the users.

In a more fresh microservice architecture style,  the application(s) is split as a collection of services but, to some extension, the outcome is still based on previous concept.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*3mAmSM4_l4QDF0aK2I_esA.png)

Users use the (web) application. It calls a dedicated service which call endpoint(s) to persist and read data and, returns the results to the users.

Regardless of these architectures, mono- or micro-services, the persistence of the data finds place for all the users at the same place.

*****

#### Code Snippet

I do not know the exact architecture of Google [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) but, from a user and outside point of view perspective, it looks like a mono-database hosted in the cloud.

If we develop, for example, an application that list the kind of animals our users own, we would most probably define a db collection of `pets` to collect their entries.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*I4CP0N8GvViWCuAzRLa3UA.png)

To query and persist the data, we would then implement a getter (`get` ) and setter (`add` ) functions in our web application that would call the cloud database.

```javascript
import firebase from 'firebase/app';
import 'firebase/firestore';

const firestore = firebase.firestore();

const get = async (entryId) => {
  const snapshot = 
            await firestore.collection('pets').doc(entryId).get();

  if (snapshot.exists) {
    console.log(snapshot.data());
  }
};

const add = async (userId, dog, cat) => {
  const {id: entryId} = await firestore.collection('pets').add({
    userId,
    dog,
    cat
  });

  console.log(entryId);
};
```

All users would use the same entry point and, their data would also be saved in the same collection (`firestore.collection('pets')` ).

*****

### The ‚ÄúConservative‚Äù

The Internet Computer does not provide a built-in out of the box database solution, that is not the goal of the DFINITY foundation (my understanding). They provide a futuristic blockchain network, that can run web applications too.

It is up to the makers to build features on the top. They can implement features and, unleash these on the IC through canister smart contracts.

I picture my self a "canister" has a container that run a set of functions in the cloud, except that it is actually a decentralized blockchain network üòâ. It can basically do anything that can be implemented, from computing to data persistence.

After studying the [documentation](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/introduction/welcome.html) of the SDK, [examples](https://github.com/dfinity/examples) and the ‚Äú[linkedup](https://github.com/dfinity/linkedup/)‚Äù demo,  our first approach had then for goal to replicate the approach we are familiar with, the one exposed previously, the ‚ÄúNowadays".

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*GK30d2fOgC-7UVWdAnrQFA.png)

However, given the blockchain nature of the Internet Computer, it may be good to imagine the architecture in a decentralized way with data shared in the form of blocks.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*jI-CDFohigqIZCibwWrcqw.png)

If we omit the chain aspect and, the decentralization, it basically works the same as what I am familiar with isn't?

*****

#### Code Snippet

The way we can picture the persistence of the data within a canister, we would develop for our "pets" web application, would be again quite similar to previous architecture.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*DcChK7ojaMYGqExH6F-YtQ.png)

Instead of key-value database collection, as there are no ‚Äúbuilt-in out of the box‚Äù database available, our actor would contain a variable that would act as such.

It can for example be a [Trie](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/base-libraries/trie), a functional maps (and sets) whose representation is ‚Äúcanonical‚Äù, and independent of operation history.

To query (`get` ) and persist (`add` ) the data,  we would be able to implement an actor, a canister, as following:

*Canisters and features unleashed in the Internet Computer can commonly either be written in [Motoko](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/language-guide/motoko.html) or [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org). Motoko is published and maintained by the DFINITY foundation and, most of the documentation‚Äôs examples are provided in that particular programming language. That is mostly why, we developed our proof of concept with it.*

```
import Trie "mo:base/Trie";
import Nat32 "mo:base/Nat32";

actor {

    type PetId = Nat32;

    type Data = {
        dog: Bool;
        cat: Bool;
        userId: Text;
    };

    private stable var entryId: PetId = 0;

    private stable var pets : Trie.Trie<PetId, Data> = Trie.empty();

    public func add(userId: Text, dog: Bool, cat: Bool): async () {
        let data = {
            userId = userId;
            dog = dog;
            cat = cat;
        };

        pets := Trie.replace(
            pets,
            key(entryId),
            Nat32.equal,
            ?data,
        ).0;

        entryId += 1;
    };

    public query func get(entryId: Nat32) : async ?Data {
        let result = Trie.find(pets, key(entryId), Nat32.equal);
        return result;
    };

    private func key(x : PetId) : Trie.Key<PetId> {
        return { hash = x; key = x };
    };

};
```

The data would be saved in the network chain, replicated and decentralized, while using an approach we are familiar with.

### The ‚ÄúFuturistic ü§Ø‚Äù

Our first "Conservative" approach validated the hypothesis that a data persistence for our web application in the Internet Compute could be realized but, what about its scalability?

In our first approach, we did not use a `Trie` as in the example but, a `HashMap` to handle our data. In that way, it would have made the system a bit more scalable, as data would have potentially been still delivered quicker even with a large amount of data. However, at some point, we might have hit some limits anyway.

In addition, a canister can only store 4GB of memory pages due to the limitations of WebAssembly implementations ([source](https://medium.com/dfinity/a-technical-overview-of-the-internet-computer-f57c62abc20f)).

That is why, we challenged our first idea and, tried to find a more scalable design.

It resulted in an architecture in which a main actor acts as a a manager that generates on the fly a decentralized secure simple key-value database-like for each single data persistence of each user ü§Ø.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Dnw7c5hNpF8cm49nCmT3JA.png)

In above diagram I displayed only two users and, did not reflect the blockchain nature of the network but, hopefully, it pictures well the idea.

A user, through the web app, requests  the manager to get his/her a personal decentralized secure simple key-value data persistence canister. Once obtained, he/she use this dedicated private space to query and persist his/her data.

*****

#### Code Snippet

We would need two actors to implement such a solution. One that acts as a ‚Äúmanager‚Äù, the canister that generate other canisters on the fly, and, an implementation for those that take care of the data persistence, those that are generated on the fly.

The ‚Äúmanager‚Äù might have to track or not the list of canisters it has generated. If end users save on their side their references, such feature might not be needed. However, in following snippet we will assume it does has to keep track of what it generates.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*i1UedTMw4GxvoiwkQI9gvw.png)

The base implementation of the manager is close to what we already implemented. However, instead of `Trie`, I used a [HashMap](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/base-libraries/hashmap) to keep track of the IDs of the canisters that has been generated.

```
import HashMap "mo:base/HashMap";
import Principal "mo:base/Principal";
import Cycles "mo:base/ExperimentalCycles";
import Iter "mo:base/Iter";

import Pet "./Pet";

actor {

  type CanisterId = Principal;
  type UserId = Principal;

  private func isPrincipalEqual(x: Principal, y: Principal): Bool {
    x == y 
  };

  private var canisters: HashMap.HashMap<UserId, CanisterId> = 
    HashMap.HashMap<UserId, CanisterId>(10, isPrincipalEqual,  
                                        Principal.hash);

  private stable var upgradeCanisters: [(Principal, CanisterId)] = 
    [];

  public shared({caller}) func create(): async (CanisterId) {
    Cycles.add(1_000_000_000_000);
    let canister = await Pet.Pet();
    let id: CanisterId = await canister.id();
    canisters.put(caller, id);

    return id;
  };

  public shared query({caller}) func get() : async ?CanisterId {
    let id: ?CanisterId = canisters.get(caller);
    return id;
  };

  system func preupgrade() {
    upgradeCanisters := Iter.toArray(canisters.entries());
  };

  system func postupgrade() {
    canisters := HashMap.fromIter<UserId, CanisterId>     
                  (upgradeCanisters.vals(), 10, 
                  isPrincipalEqual, Principal.hash);
                  upgradeCanisters := [];
  };

};
```

The function `create` takes care of unleashing new user‚Äôs canisters in the Internet Computer, those that will be used for the data persistence. It allocates first some few minimal cycles for the newly actors.

The `get` function returns, if it exists, the ID of the user‚Äôs canister.

Both `preupgrade` and `postupgrade` are used to persist the memory among upgrades (see [documentation](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/language-guide/upgrades.html)).

Once the manager being set, we would be able to implement an `actor` dedicated to the personal data persistence of a user.

```
import Principal "mo:base/Principal";

actor class Pet() = this {

  type Data = {
    dog: Bool;
    cat: Bool;
  };

  private stable var myPet: ?Data = null;
  public func set(dog: Bool, cat: Bool): async () {
    myPet := ?{
      dog = dog;
      cat = cat;
    };
  };

  public query func get() : async ?Data {
    return myPet;
  };

  public query func id() : async Principal {
    return Principal.fromActor(this);
  };

};
```

Its implementation looks familiar to what we have seen before too but, with a small important modification: there is no `entryId` anymore and, there is no `Trie` neither.

Each user has his/her own little kingdom. That's why he/she does not need an identifier to lookup the data in a big pot of data. It doesn't even have to memorize the `userId`.

It is the user's kingdom, it contains only the personal data of that particular user!

### Pros And Cons

The ultimate architecture is really scalable, as every user operates in his/her own realm. It also separates the concern in clear ownerships and fits well a secure approach.

However, it is worth noting that it is linked with more administration, whether during upgrade of their codes or handling their costs.

Nevertheless, we are big fan of this architecture and, think that the advantages are totally worth it. Therefore, it is the concept we would unleash if our proof of concept would turn into a real live productive use case.

After all, great power comes with great responsibility!

*****

### Summary

It is quite a tricky subject. I hope I was able to communicate the main idea behind these architectures and, most importantly, behind the one I called the ‚ÄúFuturistic one ü§Ø‚Äù.

To infinity and beyond!
