I have been using the same strategy to internationalize quickly [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/) components without dependencies in various projects. Among others for the project [Owlly](https://owlly.ch/) or the [Bonjour foundation](https://bonjour.help/).

As all these projects are open source, I will share with you my recipe üßë‚Äçüç≥.

### Goal

This blog post has not for goal to set up i18n for an application, design system or any other sort of projects from a certain scale. I might blog about this some day too, as I recently internationalized with the help of the community our project [DeckDeckGo](https://deckdeckgo.com), but, this article has for goal to add translations to a relatively small component or set of components without dependency.

I use this solution when I create components which contain some `slot `with default values and which have has primary market our lovely ‚Äúfour languages + english per default‚Äù Switzerland üá®üá≠.

---

### Setup

In your project create a new utility `translations.util.ts` and add the declarations.

```javascript
interface Translation {
  [key: string]: string;
}

interface Translations {
  de: Translation;
  en: Translation;
}
```

For this example, I will ‚Äúonly‚Äù use German and English. For a real life use case, extend it with your requirements.

I declared an `interface Translation` but, it can be replaced with a TypeScript `Record<string, string>` . Result is the same, as you rather like.

Following the declarations, add a constant for the default (fallback) language and a list of supported languages.

```javascript
const DEFAULT_LANGUAGE: 'en' = 'en';

const SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES: string[] = ['de', 'en'];
```

Finally, add the effective translations.

```javascript
const TRANSLATIONS: Translations = {
  de: {
    question: 'Wie f√ºhlen Sie sich heute?',
    super: 'Sehr gut',
    bad: 'Nicht gut'
  },
  en: {
    question: 'How do you feel today?',
    super: 'Super',
    bad: 'Bad'
  }
};
```

In this solution, as my goal is to keep it quick and easy, I code the translations.

It is possible to handle these in separate `json` files and `import` these dynamically at runtime. That‚Äôs two features I have developed for my more complex use case. After all I maybe really need to blog about this? Ping me if you think that would be an interesting subject!

### Detect Languages

I did not reinvent the wheel. I had a look to the widely use open source library [ngx-translate](https://github.com/ngx-translate/core) and implemented its detection of the browser languages.

In the same file, add the following function and initialization of the default language.

```javascript
const initBrowserLang = (): string | undefined => {
  if (typeof window === 'undefined'
      || typeof window.navigator === 'undefined') {
    return undefined;
  }

  let browserLang: string | null =
    window.navigator.languages
    && window.navigator.languages.length > 0 ?
              window.navigator.languages[0] : null;

  // @ts-ignore
  browserLang = browserLang || window.navigator.language || window.navigator.browserLanguage || window.navigator.userLanguage;

  if (typeof browserLang === 'undefined') {
    return undefined;
  }

  if (browserLang.indexOf('-') !== -1) {
    browserLang = browserLang.split('-')[0];
  }

  if (browserLang.indexOf('_') !== -1) {
    browserLang = browserLang.split('_')[0];
  }

  return browserLang;
}

const browserLang: string | undefined = initBrowserLang();
```

---

### Function

The setup and detection are ready, we need a function to render the translations.

```javascript
export const translate =
             (key: string, customLang?: 'de' | 'en'): string => {
  const lang: string | undefined = customLang || browserLang;
  return TRANSLATIONS[lang !== undefined
                      && SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES.includes(lang) ?
                         lang : DEFAULT_LANGUAGE][key];
};
```

It either uses the browser or a parameter language, check it against the list of supported languages or fallback to the default language, and returns the related translations.

---

### Usage

In our component, the above function can be used to render a translation.

```javascript
import { Component, h, Host } from "@stencil/core";

import { translate } from "./translations.utils";

@Component({
	tag: "question",
	shadow: true
})
export class Question {
	render() {
		return (
			<Host>
				<p>{translate("question")}</p>
				<slot name="answer">{translate("super", "de")}</slot>
			</Host>
		);
	}
}
```

It renders text, with or without specifying a language, and can be used with `slot` too.

That was my small quick recipe to set up i18n to a relatively small set of components. I hope it is useful and if you think I should share the more complex solution in another post, let me know.

To infinity and beyond!
