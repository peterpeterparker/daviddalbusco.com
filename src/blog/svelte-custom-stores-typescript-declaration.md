Svelte offers some nice easy-to-use store concepts. One of those is "[custom stores](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/custom-stores)" which makes handy the obfuscation of the reactive stored data and its access through a set of custom defined functions.

e.g. for a counter that counts apples and bananas, I can create a custom store that does not expose directly my data. Within a function, I can "hide" the store and expose only the functions I want to use in my apps instead of exposing publicly `set` and `update`. This to avoid misbehavior and unexpected changes, what can be really useful as the code base grows.

```typescript
import { writable } from "svelte/store";

export interface Counter {
	apples: number;
	bananas: number;
}

const initStore = () => {
	const initialCounter: Counter = {
		apples: 0,
		bananas: 0
	};

	const { subscribe, set, update } = writable(initialCounter);

	return {
		subscribe,
		incBanana: () =>
			update(({ bananas, ...rest }) => ({
				...rest,
				bananas: bananas + 1
			})),
		decBanana: () =>
			update(({ bananas, ...rest }) => ({
				...rest,
				bananas: bananas - 1
			})),
		reset: () => set(initialCounter)
	};
};

export const counter = initStore();
```

Above code snippet follows Svelte's documentation example with the addition of a type - `Counter` - for the object saved in my store and few custom functions - `incBanana`, `decBanana` and `reset`.

_Note that I just did not implement the "apples" related functions to keep the snippet small. In a real use case I might have even extracted the `update()` part to a function to avoid double code but, I also skipped this part because it would have not much value in this blog post context._

When bind in a component, it works as expected.

However, even if `npm run dev|build|check` are all fine, Webstorm is not being able to derive the store values when used in a TypeScript `script` block.

I do not know exactly if it is yet another issue of the Jetbrains Svelte plugin or if the store is derived as `any` type by the bundler (which would ignore the `strict` option ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è). Nevertheless, I rather like to fix the issue by improving the type declaration of the store.

Because my custom store exposes my home made functions but, also the root `subscribe` feature, its declaration has to providing support for it as well.

Therefore the most easy way in my opinion is to inherits the existing `Readable` type of Svelte.

```typescript
import { type Readable } from "svelte/store";

export interface AuthStore extends Readable<Counter> {
	incBanana: () => void;
	decBanana: () => void;
	reset: () => void;
}
```

By setting the generic types to my custom data type - `Counter` - I can instruct which type is handled in the store and by declaring my functions, I can improve the typings.

I can use this new interface to set the return type of the initialization function - `initStore` - and that's already it.

```typescript
import { writable, type Readable } from "svelte/store";

export interface Counter {
	apples: number;
	bananas: number;
}

export interface AuthStore extends Readable<Counter> {
	incBanana: () => void;
	decBanana: () => void;
	reset: () => void;
}

const initStore = (): AuthStore => {
	const initialCounter: Counter = {
		apples: 0,
		bananas: 0
	};

	const { subscribe, set, update } = writable(initialCounter);

	return {
		subscribe,
		incBanana: () =>
			update(({ bananas, ...rest }) => ({
				...rest,
				bananas: bananas + 1
			})),
		decBanana: () =>
			update(({ bananas, ...rest }) => ({
				...rest,
				bananas: bananas - 1
			})),
		reset: () => set(initialCounter)
	};
};

export const counter = initStore();
```

When I open my component, I notice that Webstorm now understands correctly the type of my data.

To infinity and beyond
