	<p>Hi there! It's great to meet you! üëã</p>
	<p>I'm a freelance web developer and contractor based in Z√ºrich, Switzerland.</p>

	<p>
		My expertise lies in
		<mark> <a href="https://svelte.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Svelte</a></mark>,
		<mark> <a href="https://angular.io" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angular</a></mark>,
		<mark>
			<a href="https://reactjs.org" rel="noopener noreferrer">React</a>
		</mark>
		and
		<mark>
			<a href="https://stenciljs.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">StencilJS</a>
		</mark>, but I'm particularly passionate about developing agnostic JavaScript/TypeScript
		solutions.
	</p>
	<p>
		I believe in the principles of decentralization and data ownership, which is why I have a keen
		interest in blockchain networks. As a proud supporter of the <mark>
			<a href="https://internetcomputer.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Internet Computer</a>
		</mark>, I see tremendous potential in its future.
	</p>
	<p>
		In addition to my technical skills, I have experience in project management, business
		requirements analysis, and UX design from a developer's perspective. I hold degrees in Computer
		Engineering and an Executive Master's in Business Administration. I'm also fluent in French,
		German, and English.
	</p>
	<p>
		When I'm not busy coding, you can often find me running on mountain trails or along the river.
		It's my way of finding peace and staying active. ‚õ∞üèÉ
	</p>
	<p>
		If you have a web or mobile project in mind, feel free to
		<a href="/#contact" rel="noopener noreferrer">reach out!</a> I would be more than happy to discuss
		how I can contribute to the success of your project.
