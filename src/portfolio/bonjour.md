# Bonjour - Circle

I develop several components and applications for the [Bonjour Foundation](https://bonjour.help) together with [customfuture SA](https://www.customfuture.com/).

"Bonjour" is a charity "Think-and-do Tank" projects, an incubator for idea, tools and impulse for a better self-determined life.

Their goal is to work together for a better future.
