# DFINITY

I first started collaborating with [DFINITY](https://dfinity.org) by redeveloping the Network Nervous System (NNS) frontend dapp and its ecosystem. The [NNS dapp](https://nns.internetcomputer.org/) is a decentralized web application that holders of ICP tokens can use to stake neurons to participate in governance and contribute to decision-making.

In parallel, I helped build various prototypes, such as the [Voluntary Recycling Credits](https://recyclingcredit.org/) initiative.

Later, I worked extensively on [OISY Wallet](https://oisy.com/), a browser-based multi-chain wallet that supports ICP, Bitcoin, Ethereum, twin tokens on the IC, and more. I also created its signer library to enable secure communication between relying parties and wallets.

Ultimately, in 2025, I continued supporting both the NNS dapp, OISY, and the broader ecosystem, but I was also sponsored to dedicate time to my own project [Juno](/portfolio/juno), an open source serverless platform which was beneficial to the Internet Computer.

## Open source

The projects of the foundation are open source. Those to which I collaborated the most on GitHub are:

- [OISY Wallet](https://github.com/dfinity/oisy-wallet): A browser-based, multi-chain wallet hosted on the Internet Computer.
- [NNS Dapp](https://github.com/dfinity/nns-dapp/): The Dapp for the Governance of ICP.
- [ic-js](https://github.com/dfinity/ic-js/): A set of libraries for interfacing with the Internet Computer.
- [OISY Wallet Signer](https://github.com/dfinity/oisy-wallet-signer/): a lightweight library designed to connect dApps with the OISY Wallet, enabling secure message signing and transaction approvals.
- [Gix components](https://github.com/dfinity/gix-components): A collection of UI components and visual style for web applications.
