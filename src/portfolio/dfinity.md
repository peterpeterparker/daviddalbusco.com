# DFINITY

I first started collaborating with [DFINITY](https://dfinity.org) by redeveloping the Network Nervous System (NNS) frontend dapp and its ecosystem. The [NNS dapp](https://nns.internetcomputer.org/) is a decentralized web application that holders of ICP tokens can notably use to lock their tokens in neurons to participate in governance and contribute to decision-making.

Following this, I helped build various prototypes, such as the [Voluntary Recycling Credits](https://recyclingcredit.org/) initiative.

Currently, I am working on [Oisy Wallet](https://oisy.com/), a browser-based, multi-chain wallet that notably supports Ethereum and twin tokens on the IC.
