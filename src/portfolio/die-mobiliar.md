# Die Mobiliar

I collaborated with [die Mobiliar](https://www.mobiliar.ch/) (La Mobili√®re, La Mobiliare), a Swiss insurance group that employs more than 4'000 persons, as an external developer for two years.

Through this mandate, I took part in all the activities and development of the team I was attached to.

Together we develop new Angular applications (SPA) and libraries which were integrated in the internal ERP of the company.
