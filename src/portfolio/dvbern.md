# DV Bern AG

I collaborate with [DV Bern AG](https://www.dvbern.ch/), a company by which I used to be employed, on a project related to the commercial register ("Handelsregister" / "Register du commerce").

DV Bern AG provides the most used ERP solution in Switzerland for such administrations.

The project's scope was the development of a new process which had an influence on both the online end clients of the registers and the workflow of their employees.
