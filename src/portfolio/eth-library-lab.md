# ETH Library Lab

I am providing consulting services to the [ETH Library Lab](https://www.librarylab.ethz.ch/), an initiative for human-centered innovation in the knowledge sphere from [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/).

The lab has for mission to help students, researchers and educators to unleash their full potential by boosting ideas that support them in discovering, accessing, using or sharing scientific information and knowledge.

As part of their projects, I use my engineering background and experience to provide:

- advices on project management, planning and services
- discuss technical questions
- recommandations on design and UX topics
- support regarding the open source and prototyping concepts

## Open source

The Lab seeks to advance tools, systems, practices and services and therefore will publish, at least, some projects and prototypes as open source software on[GitHub](https://github.com/eth-library-lab)
