# Juno

Juno is an open-source Blockchain-as-a-Service platform that makes building decentralized apps faster and easier than ever before ‚ö°Ô∏èüöÄü§Ø.

Unlike traditional Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platforms like Google Firebase or AWS Amplify, Juno runs entirely on the blockchain.

It allows developers to outsource all the behind-the-scenes aspects of your web or mobile development, giving you the ability to focus on the frontend.

The platform operates without controlling their data or work.
