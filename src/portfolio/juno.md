# Juno

[Juno](https://juno.build) is an open source serverless platform for building and deploying modern web applications. It provides hosting, data storage, authentication, assets, serverless functions, and analytics, all running inside an isolated WebAssembly container.

Projects are developed locally using an emulator that mirrors production. Frontend frameworks such as React, Next.js, and SvelteKit integrate directly, while backend logic is implemented with serverless functions in Rust or TypeScript. Deployment produces a single artifact that can be pushed via the CLI or GitHub Actions.

Each application runs in its own container under full ownership and control. Juno has no access to user code, data, or infrastructure. The platform delivers a familiar cloud development experience with the privacy and sovereignty of self hosting.

Think of it as **Vercel + Firebase + Self-Hosting** - without the compromises.
