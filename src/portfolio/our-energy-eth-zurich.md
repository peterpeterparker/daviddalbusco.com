# Our Energy - ETH Z端rich

I have developed the application "Our Energy" for a team of researchers at the [ETH Z端rich](https://ethz.ch/).

It is a mobile and web application for citizens to learn how they can intelligently use electricity produce from a community scale PV system. This is especially for people who have not yet installed solar or who are interested in solar.

This app was notably used as a support for a 2-week energy challenge in June 2019 for the people of Einsiedeln in Switzerland.
