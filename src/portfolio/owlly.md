# Owlly

I had the opportunity to participate to [Owlly](https://owlly.ch/), an amazing and meaningful open source project, which enables the secure and easy electronic signing, validation and counting of popular initiatives and referendums for campaign platforms and offers a holistic e-collecting approach for SwitzerlandðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­.

As part of this project, I notably developed a Web Component which can be integrated in any websites or applications to ease the access to the Owlly's wizard.

In addition, I supported the team in their technical decisions and also developed some part of the website, wizard and cloud functions.
