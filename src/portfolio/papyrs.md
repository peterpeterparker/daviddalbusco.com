# Papyrs

Papyrs is an open-source, privacy-first, decentralized blogging platform that lives 100% on chain!

## Architecture

The application primarily works offline and can therefore be used by anyone out of the box. It uses [Internet Identity](https://identity.ic0.app/) as anonymous authentication provider and create two canister smart contracts for each user who sign-in to save and share their blog posts online.
