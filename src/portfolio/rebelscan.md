# Rebel Scan

Christmas 2020, beside visiting my parents for a couple of days, I had no big plans. That's why, I took the opportunity to improve my software development knowledge.

My goals were the following:

1. Give a try to [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
2. Capture and crop a video stream using the [MediaDevices.getUserMedia()](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia) API
3. Generate [React](https://reactjs.org/) bindings for a Web Component developed with [StencilJS](https://stenciljs.com/)
4. Share files using strictly only the [Web Share](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/API/Navigator/share) API

I called the prototype [Rebel Scan](https://rebelscan.com/) because, it is just a little scanner app, you rebel scum!
